    Pusher is a hosted service with APIs and libraries that makes it really easy
    to add real-time data and functionality to web, mobile and IoT applications.
    
    We sit between your servers and your client apps as a real-time layer
    so that any time your server has data it wants to push to connected
    apps, it can. Instantly.
    
    Your clients can also send messages to each other via Pusher. But only once
    your server has authenticated them.
    
    Here are some examples of what people are building with Pusher.

    # Activity Streams
    
    ???
    
    Activity Streams are used in applications such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+.
    You can add a streams of real-time status or activity updates.

    # Data Visualizations
    
    ???
    
    Visualising real-time data can help users see trends and make predictions. 
    Think real-time dashboards.

    Everybody uses some sort of real-time chat or messenging application. Pusher
    makes it really easy to add chat to your web and mobile apps.

    If you've used Google Docs then you're familiar with the power of real-time
    collaborative apps. Working together in online apps can be a very efficient 
    and an amazing user experience.

    # Code & Demos
    
    ???
    
    I'm now going to show you some sample code, and demonstrate a few
    simple ways you can use Pusher.

    ## Trigger an Event
    
    ```js
    require 'pusher'
    ```
    
    ???
    
    This example shows you how easy it is to send a message through Pusher. Since
    it's the real-time web, we refer to this as "Triggering Events".
    
    1. Include the Pusher library in your server code - we have libraries for Ruby, Python, PHP, Node and many more
    
    --
    ```js
    Pusher.app_id = 'PUSHER_APP_ID'
    Pusher.key = 'PUSHER_APP_KEY'
    Pusher.secret = 'PUSHER_APP_SECRET'
    ```
    
    ???
    
    2. Set the credentials for your Pusher application - you get these once you signup for a free account
    
    --
    ```js
    channel_name = 'notifications'
    event_name = 'new-notification'
    event_data = {msg: 'Hello'}
    Pusher.trigger(channel_name, event_name, event_data);
    ```
    
    ???
    
    3. Trigger an event - we use channel names to identify the data and event names to say what's happened to that data e.g. notifications and new-notification
    
    --
    
    It's that easy!
    
    --
    
    <form class="notifications-form">
      <select name="message">
        <option value="こんにちは">Konnichiwa</option>
        <option value="私は日本が大好き">I Love Japan</option>
      </select>
      <input type="submit" value="Send" class="btn btn-large btn-green" />
    </form>
    
    ???
    
    I've got a few options here to trigger events and send them via a server and to
    your device.
    
    ---
    
    class: code, top, code-reveal
    
    ## Subscribe & Bind to Event
    
    ???
    
    Now that we're triggering data from the server we want to receive the data
    within our web, mobile or IoT apps and do something with it.
    
    --
    
    ```js
    <script src="//js.pusher.com/3.0/pusher.min.js"></script>
    ```
    
    ???
    
    1. Include the client library
    
    --
    ```html
    <script>
    // Connect
    var pusher = new Pusher(PUSHER_APP_KEY);
    ```
    
    ???
    
    2. Connect to Pusher using your Pusher Application Key.
    
    --
    ```js
    
    // Subscribe
    var channel = pusher.subscribe('notifications');
    ```
    
    ???
    
    3. Subscribe to the channel - in this case 'notifications'
    
    --
    ```js
    
    // Bind to event
    channel.bind('new-notification', function(data) {
    ```
    --
    ```js
      // For example...
      showNotification(data.msg);
    });
    </script>
    ```
    
    ???
    
    4. Bind to the event and pass in an event handled - our event is called 'new-notification'
    5. Do something in the handler - e.g. show a notification
    
    Next: demo
    
    --
    
    <button class="btn btn-green btn-large notifications-btn">Subscribe</button>
    
    ---
    
    class: code, top, code-reveal
    
    ## Rules for Trigger events from clients
    
    ```js
    var pusher = new Pusher(KEY);
    ```
    --
    ```js
    // Subscribe to channels that require authentication
    // private-
    // presence-
    
    var channel = pusher.subscribe('private-channel-name');
    ```
    --
    ```js
    // Wait for the subscription to succeed
    channel.bind('pusher:subscription_succeeded', function() {
    ```
    
    --
    ```js
      // Trigger "client-" prefixed event
    
      channel.trigger('client-event', data);
    });
    ```
    
    **To trigger events from the client (web | mobile) you need to authenticate the channel subscription from your server**
    
    ???
    
    As well as sending events from the server you can trigger events from client apps. 
    However, you must first authenticate those apps to do so via your server.
    
    Three important things to remember
    
    1. The channel name must either be prefixed with `private-` or `presence-`
    2. You need to authenticate these subscriptions from your server
    3. Trigger events once subscribed
    4. The event name must be prefixed with `client-`

    #### Live User Lists (Presence)
    
    ```js
    var pusher = new Pusher('KEY');
    ```
    
    ???
    
    A common requirement in real-time apps is to know who else is online. To have
    a real-time updating list of friends. Pusher provides this via presence channels.

    1. Connect to Pusher
    
    --
    ```js
    
    // subscribe to presence- prefixed channel
    var presence = pusher.subscribe('presence-users');
    ```
    
    ???
    
    2. Subscribe to a presence channel - with a `presence-` channel name
    
    --
    
    ```js
    
    // bind to events
    presence.bind('pusher:subscription_succeeded', function(members) {
      // General simple shortcut
      members.each(memberAdded);
    });
    ```
    
    ???
    
    3. Bind to the succeeded event to get an initial list of online users
    
    --
    
    ```js
    // Bind to added/removed events
    presence.bind('pusher:member_added', memberAdded);
    presence.bind('pusher:member_removed', memberRemoved);

    // handler functions
    function memberAdded(member) {
      // show the user is online
    }
    
    function memberRemoved(member) {
      // show the user is offline
    }
    ```
    
    ???
    
    4. Bind to added and removed events so you can updated the list as users come online and go offline.
